### Markets

We believe in emerging markets. There is potential, talent and hunger. Emerging
markets are currently experiencing fast transformations in many different
industries like banking, technology, agriculture or energy. And where there is
change, there is opportunity. And on top of it, we know that there are a number
of extremely talented individuals with great ideas, strong teams that are in
the search of a hand to grow fast or expand into other markets. It is there
where we want to be. And it is this hand that we are sure we can give, because
we know how to do it, and because it is what we are passionate about.

Our initial for the companies we will invest in is South America. Startups based
in  Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela are part of our scope. The region of South America shares many
interesting features that make it very attractive and yet has a large room to
grow.
